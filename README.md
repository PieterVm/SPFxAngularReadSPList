# SPFxAngularReadSPList

I'm new @ this so the code is not that clean but I gave it a try: read a list from sharepoint with angular 4 and sharepoint framework

1. npm install
2. config/write.manifest.json => change cdn to your list (I did it with a list with fields: Title, Picture, Link)
3.gulp serve (you get mock-data)
4. For the real data => https://{sharepoint-tenant}/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx#/
